<h1>Roman Numbers</h1>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>
This is the translation of a talk given in French
during the French Perl Workshop in 2009.
There are a few differences with the original talk. Since I have no
time limit for this HTML file, there are
a few points which were skipped during the talk.
And also, a few points I did not dig enough
before the conference and which I fixed
later.

Let us note that Karl Menninger is a linguist, which is why
he is interested in spoken as well as written numbers.
Geneviève Guitel and Georges Ifrah are mathematicians
and are therefore mostly interested in written numbers.

of the author and the page number. If you have a different edition
(the English translation of Georges Ifrah's book, for example),
well, too bad for you, you will have to guess!
</p>

<h2>CPAN, <tt>Roman.pm</tt></h2>

The fist Perl module dealing with roman numbers is simply named
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Roman/'><tt>Roman</tt></a>.
It was originally written by Ozawa Sakuro who maintained it from
1995 to 1997. Since 2007, it is maintained by
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/~chorny/'>Alexandr Ciornii</a>,
although
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/~mirod'>Michel Rodriguez</a> 
has volunteered to maintain it a few years earlier, but
without obtaining co-maintenance status.
The current version is 1.23. Example:
<pre>
use Roman;

for my $ar (qw/1 5 8 40 84/) {
  my $rm = Roman($ar);
  print "$ar -&gt; $rm\n";
}

for my $rm (qw/I IV VII XIV LII LXXXIV/) {
  my $ar = arabic($rm);
  print "$rm -&gt; $ar\n";
}

</pre>

<h2>CPAN, <tt>Math::Roman</tt></h2>

There is also <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-Roman/'><tt>Math::Roman</tt></a>
by <a href='http://search.cpan.org/~tels/'>Tels</a>.
The current version is 1.07.
Example:
<pre>
use Math::Roman;

for (qw/1 5 8 40 84 I IV VII XIV LII LXXXIV/) {
  my $roman = Math::Roman-&gt;new($_);
  my $arab  = $roman-&gt;as_number;
  print "$arab -&gt; $roman\n";
}
</pre>

<p>This module allows you to redefine the characters used for
roman numbers. Here is an example from the module's POD,
where 25 is written "AAB", with "A" for 10 and "B" for 5:
</p>
<pre>
Math::Roman::tokens ( qw(A 10 B 5) );
$r = Math::Roman::roman('AAB');
print "'$r' is ",$r-&gt;as_number(),"\n";
</pre>

<p>In the following, I will differentiate between
the "basic" variant and the "advanced" variant.
The basic variant does not use the <tt>tokens</tt>
function, while the advanced variant uses it.
</p>

<h2>CPAN, <tt>Text::Roman</tt></h2>

The third module is <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Roman/'><tt>Text::Roman</tt></a>
by Peter de Padua Krauss, yet it appears in

<a href='http://search.cpan.org/~syp/'>Stanislas Pusep</a>'s
directory. The current version is 3.01.
Example:
<pre>
use Text::Roman;

for my $ar (qw/1 5 8 40 84/) {
  my $rm = roman($av);
  print "$ar -&gt; $rm\n";
}

for my $rm (qw/I IV VII XIV LII LXXXIV xiv lii lxxxiv /) {
  my $ar = roman2int($rm);
  print "$rm -&gt; $ar\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
I nearly missed this module, because I equated "Roman" to
"Latin" and the association between "Text" and "Roman/Latin"
makes me think of the ISO-8859-1 encoding.
</p>

<h2>CPAN, <tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt></h2>

The fourth module is
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Convert-Number-Roman/'><tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt></a>
by <a href='http://search.cpan.org/~dyacob/'>Daniel Yacob</a>.
The current version is 0.01.
Example:
<pre>
use Convert::Number::Roman;
use utf8;

for my $av (1, 5, 8, 40, 84, 
	    "&#8544;", "&#8553;", "&#8556;&#8546;", "&#8553&#8557;",
            ) {
  my $cnr = Convert::Number::Roman-&gt;new($av);
  my $ap = $cnr-&gt;convert;
  print "$av -&gt; $ap\n";
}

</pre>

<h2>CPAN, <tt>Roman::Unicode</tt></h2>

<p>At last a module which is compatible with the theme of
<a href="http://yapceurope.lv/ye2011/">YAPC::Europe 2011</a>,
"Modern Perl". Not only this is a recent module
(first released in July 2011), but it is also a modern
module, which requires Perl 5.14.0.</p>
<pre>
use utf8;
use feature ':5.14';
use Roman::Unicode qw/to_roman is_roman to_perl/;

for (qw/1 3 26 84 1234 4321 12345 64321 222333/) {
  my $r = to_roman($_);
  say $_, ' ', $r;
}

for (qw/&#8544; &#8544;&#8544;&#8544; &#8553;&#8553;&#8548;&#8544; &#8556;&#8553;&#8553;&#8553;&#8544;&#8548;/) {
  if (is_roman($_)) {
    my $n = to_perl($_);
    say $_, ' ', $n;
  }
  else {
    say "$_ invalid roman number";
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>CPAN, <tt>Acme::Roman</tt></h2>

Less serious, as the <tt>Acme</tt> prefix shows, here is
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Acme-Roman/'><tt>Acme::Roman</tt></a>
by <a href='http://search.cpan.org/~ferreira/'>Adriano Ferreira</a>.
The current version is 0.0.2.12.
Example
<pre>
use Acme::Roman;

my $a = LXX;
my $b = XIV;
print $a + $b, "\n";

</pre>

<p>
This module requires <tt>Roman.pm</tt> and adds some
<tt>AUTOLOAD</tt> magic, therefore the limits of
<tt>Roman.pm</tt> described below apply also to
<tt>Acme::Roman</tt>.
</p>

<h2>CPAN, <tt>Lingua::Romana::Perligata</tt></h2>

<p>
Even without an <tt>Acme</tt> prefix,
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lingua-Romana-Perligata/'><tt>Lingua::Romana::Perligata</tt></a>
is another module "for fun", written by
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/~dconway/'>Damian Conway</a>.
The current version is 0.50. Example:
</p>

<pre>
use Lingua::Romana::Perligata;

cumula meis listis III tum IV tum XC tum LX.

per quisque nombrum in listis fac sic 
  nombrum            tum novumversum egresso scribe.
  nombrum comementum tum novumversum egresso scribe.
cis
</pre>

<p>
Translation:
</p>

<pre>
use Roman;

push my @list, 3, 4, 90, 60;

foreach $nombr (@list) {
  print STDOUT $nombr, "\n";
  print STDOUT Roman::Roman($nombr), "\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
(<i lang='la'>comementum</i> does not mean that you call the
<tt>Roman</tt> module and the homonymous function, but
that you want to print the value in roman numbers rather
than arabic. I have translated this with a call to
<tt>Roman</tt> because the result is the same).
Another example written by Robin Berjon for a 
<a href='http://paris.mongueurs.net/aplusplus.html'>web page that might interest you</a>:
</p>

<pre>
use Lingua::Romana::Perligata;
ao postincresce.
</pre>

<h2><tt>perl.plover.com</tt></h2>

<p>
Mark-Jason Dominus gives you an
<a href='http://perl.plover.com/#Roman'>original proposition for roman numbers</a>.
Unlike Adriano Ferreira who used <tt>AUTOLOAD</tt>, M-J D 
used <tt>tie</tt> for his achievements.
</p>

<pre>
use Roman;

print "IX + IX = ", $IX + $IX, "\n";

print "XI * IV = ", $XI * $IV, "\n";

print "II ** X = ", $II ** $X, "\n";

print "M - I = ", $M-$I, "\n";

print "Powers of II:\n";
for ($p = $I; $p < $CLVI; $p *= $II) {
  print "\t", $p, "\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
I did not install it on my computer.
</p>

<h2>CPAN, others</h2>

<p>
I did not try
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/~book/Acme-MetaSyntactic-0.99/lib/Acme/MetaSyntactic/roman.pm'><tt>Acme::MetaSyntactic::roman</tt></a>
by <a href='http://search.cpan.org/~ambs/'>Alberto Manuel Brandão Simões</a>
and <a href='http://search.cpan.org/~book/'>BooK</a>,
because it does not aim at converting numbers
from roman numerals to arabic numerals or the other way.
I did not try either 
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/~jquelin/Language-Befunge-4.13/lib/Language/Befunge/lib/ROMA.pm'><tt>Language::Befunge::lib::ROMA</tt></a>
by <a href='http://search.cpan.org/~jquelin/'>Jérôme Quelin</a>.
</p>

<p>
And there are certainly other places where you can find other
examples of roman number conversions.
</p>

<p>
I must amend the statements given above. The rules
presented and then considered as wrong are the rules
of a simplified (dumbed down) Roman numeral system used since
the XXth century. But during the period before,
until the XIXth century, examples contradicting these
rules are abundant.
If you have to use Roman numerals in a corporate context
(e.g. for the generation of web pages), use this simplified number
system. On the other hand, if you want to optimize the fun factor,
read the following.

<h2>Based on the letters M D C L X V and I?</h2>

</font></p>

<p>
In ancient carvings, you find other glyphs for L 
(via Popilia) and for D, different from the glyphs we are
used to see. The hypothesis proposed by KM 242 and GI 144 
is that these symbols come from carving notches on sticks,
as is practised by shepherds. Later, the characters deriving
from these notches were assimilated to letters.
</p>

<p>
Acccording to KM 243, the symbol for 50 is derived
from the primitive symbol for 100, cut in half.
Then this symbol gradually evolved into the well-known "L".

<p>
KM 243 mentions an hypothesis from Mommsen, but without 
adding faith to it. The Etruscan alphabet (which became the
Roman alphabet later) is derived from the Greek alphabet,
but some letters such as &#936; and &#920;  were
left aside. Mommsen believes that the Etruscans adopted
these two letters to use them as numerals. GG 204 
mentions a similar hypothesis from 
J. Marouzeau without adding faith either.

The inscription on Columna Rostrata was carved in 260 B.C.
It is therefore in the public domain. 
You can also see it in KM44, GG214 and GI340.
Likewise, Descartes and Spinoza, although much younger
than Duilius, lived in the XVIIth century, so
their books are too in the public domain.

<p>
For 1000, the ancient symbol is "(|)" (or
"&#8576;", or "&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;") and for
D, this is "|)" (or "&#8544;&#8579;"), which can be seen
on Duilius' Columna Rostrata and which has lived on for
centuries, since it appears on frontispices of
Descartes' and Spinoza's books. Another glyph exists, similar
to a "bow-tie" &#8734; which,
according to KM 245, was picked up by Wallis to designate infinity.
</p>

<p>
This may be the reason the Unicode Consortium decided to attribute 
<a href='http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2150.pdf'>specific codepoints to Roman numerals</a>, 
instead of the U+0041 to U+005A (65 to 90) code points of the Latin alphabet.

<p>
There are a few problems. Why did they need to declare II, III
IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI and XII in addition to I, V and X? 
Why did they stop at 12?
(A likely hypothesis is that they defined all these twelve codepoints to allow
the drawing of clockfaces with Unicode chars.
Another likely hypothesis is that the Unicode Consortium attempts to
reach a kind of ascending compatibility by defining characters which
have been in use at some point in older computers and that the
composite Roman Numerals come from such an old computer system.)
What will VII, VIII and XII look like in a monospaced font?
</p>
<pre>
7 = &#8550;, 8 = &#8551;, 12 = &#8555;
</pre>
<p>
Why did they use the same code point for C for 100 
and for C as the first element of "&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;"? 
Why did they use the same code point for I for 1 
and for I as the middle part of "&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;"? 
</p>
<p>
There is yet a limited use for these characters. If you have a long
Twitter message (142 chars or so), and if your message is about Vivien Leigh,
Asterix, Obelix or Liv Ullmann, you can spare one character by typing
&#8549;&#8565;en Leigh, Aster&#8568;, Obel&#8568; and L&#8563; Ullmann.
</p>
<p>
And sorry about U+2186, U+2187 and U+2188, they come from a recent version
of the Unicode standard, more recent than the fonts in use on
my PC, so I had to use screen hard-copies.
</p>

<h3>Perl</h3>
<p>
<tt>Roman</tt>, <tt>Math::Roman</tt> basic variant 
and <tt>Text::Roman</tt> do not support Unicode.
</p>
<p>
<tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt> supports <em>only</em> Unicode, 
but it does not undestand "(|)", either in the form "\x{2180}" ("&#8576;")
or in the form  "\x{216D}\x{2160}\x{2183}" ("&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;").
Actually, <tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt> is a faithful implementation of
<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists/'>http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists/</a> 
which requires the use of the range
U+2160 -&gt; U+2183
but ignores U+0043 ("C"), U+0044 ("D") etc.
Also, for 1000, this specification mentions only
U+216F ("M") but neither U+2180 ("&#8576") 
nor the combination U+216D,U+2160,U+2183 ("&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;").
</p>
<p>
<tt>Roman::Unicode</tt> understands the Unicode chars, 
while taking in account only the following chars:
U+2160 "I", U+2164 "V", U+2169 "X"
U+2174 "L", U+2175 "C", U+2176 "D",
U+2177 "M", U+2181 "|))", U+2182 "((|))",
U+2187 "|)))" et U+2188 "(((|)))".
It does not use the composite chars, and I am glad
of it.
In addition, the module allows you to 
use the ASCII chars, between U+0020 and U+007E.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to what I said during the 2009 talk, <tt>Math::Roman</tt>
advanced variant (that is, using <tt>tokens()</tt>)
supports Unicode. Depending on whether you want to use the range from
U+2161 (&#8545;) to U+2168 (&#8552;) or not, the number
of parameters transmitted to  <tt>tokens()</tt> will be big
or small. And if you want to recognise 
U+216A (&#8554;) and U+216B (&#8555;) as well, it turns huge.
But Tels (the author of this module) is not the one I blame for
this inconvenience. 
<a href='ex-mr-ut.en.html' name='ex-mr-ut'>Here is a script</a> 
to illustrate the use of Unicode with <tt>Math::Roman</tt>.

</p>
<h2>Based on the letters M D C L X V and I? (continued)</h2>

<p>
When lower case letters appeared, during the Middle Ages,
they were also used for Roman numerals. In some cases,
for aesthetic reasons or to prevent crookery, a final
"i" was turned into a "j". The Unicode Consortium did not
opt to create a separate codepoint for the numeral "j",
maybe they considered it is a glyph variant of the same
character (remember that Unicode does not want to
deal with glyphs; see for example the initial, median,
final and isolated glyphs of arabic letters).
</p>

<p>
The Romans used the "S" letter for the fraction 1/2, the only
fraction they were used to. You may note that a 
sesterce is worth 2.5 as. Therefore, the abbreviation HS
for sesterce really commes from "IIS" (with an horizontal stroke).
And the etymology of the word is "nearly three", that is,
"3 minus 0.5". KM 160-285 notes also a I with a small
oblique stroke for 0.5, a V with a small oblique stroke for 4.5
and an X with a small oblique stroke for 9.5. The Unicode
Consortium did not think necessary to create codepoints
for the "S" numeral or for the "I", "V" and "X" with a stroke.
</p>

<h3>Perl</h3>
<p>
None of the five "serious" modules accepts the "S" numeral.
<tt>Roman</tt>, <tt>Text::Roman</tt> and <tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt> 
accept lower case letters (U+2170 to U+217F for <tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt>) 
but not <tt>Math::Roman</tt> (basic). <tt>Roman</tt>, <tt>Roman::Unicode</tt>, <tt>Math::Roman</tt> and 
<tt>Text::Roman</tt> reject the "j" numeral variant. For
<tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt>, as I already said for Unicode,
this can be considered as a glyph variant, therefore not the
module's business.
</p>

On some rather old clockfaces, the quadruple "I" applies not only to 4, but also
to 9 and even, when this is a 24-hour clockface, to 14, 19 and 24.
</p>

<h3>Perl</h3>
<p>
<tt>Roman</tt>, <tt>Math::Roman</tt> (basic variant) and <tt>Text::Roman</tt> 
reject a quadriplicated symbol.
<tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt>  accepts a quadriplicated "X",
or "C", or "M". It even accepts a quintiplicated symbol
(I tried with "C"). As for the quadriplicate "I", in a similar
way to the "j" numeral, you can consider that "IIII" is a glyph
variant of U+2163 = "IV".
<tt>Roman::Unicode</tt> accepts quadriplicated symbols.
For <tt>Math::Roman</tt> advanced variant, here is how you
can accept quadriplicated symbols.

                     "V", 5,
                     "VIIII",  9, "IX",   9,

                     "L", 50);

for (1, 5, 8, 13, 40, 44, 84, "I", 
      "XXXXIV", "LXXXXIV") {
  my $roman = Math::Roman->new($_);
  my $arab  = $roman-&gt;as_number;
  print "$_ -&gt; $arab -> $roman";
  print "\n";
}
</pre>
<p>
This version accept quadriplicated symbols as well
as subtractions. When converting from arabic
to roman, the script will print 4 as "IIII"
and 9 as "IX". You will have inconsistencies
such as  49 = "XXXXIX", but this example was 
essentially a demo of what can
be done, not a pedagogical example of what should be done.

<h2>Subtraction of I from L, C, D or M, subtraction of X from D or M</h2>

GG 226 evokes a book published in
Leyden in 1599, that is,
"&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;&#8544;&#8579;&#8544;&#8557;". 
Therefore, subtracting I from other than V or X, 
in this case from C, is allowed. On the other hand
this number may be a one-of-a-kind and GG explains
that this breaking of the rule (if it really breaks
a rule) brings an aesthetic expression of 1599.
</p>
<p>
There is also the commemoration of archbisshop Karl Berg (Carolus Berg in Latin), in Salzburg.
Karl Berg died in 1997, which is carved as "MIIIM", subtracting several I's from an M.

<p>
Once more, back to the
<a href='http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Popilia'><i lang='el'>Via Popilia</i></a>, 
The stone carver had a few problems with line length when he
carved the distance until Reggio de Calabre, to write
321 as "CCCXXI" and he had to write it on
two lines. He already had a similar problem
when writing the 84-mile distance until Capua,
but there, he fixed this problem by writing this distance
as "XXCIIII", which is more compact than
"LXXXIV". We find the same writing of 84 on the
frontispice of a book written by
Georgette de Montenay, published in 1584, that is,
"&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;.&#8544;&#8579;.XXCIIII.". 
And we cannot pretend that the printer was using a narrow
space to print the date.
</p>
<p>
More recently, there was the year 1997 carved as "MIIIM", see above.
There was also the "Palm IIIx", which
some people call  "Palm7". And last, there is
a paragraph on the French Wikipedia page, about the
<a href='http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9ration_romaine#Extensions_modernes'>modern extensions</a> 
of the <a href='http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9ration_romaine'>Roman Numbers</a>, 
but I doubt that the mechanisms described there are real.

Note that if you want to find <em>interesting</em> pages
about Roman numbers on Google, you must not
look for "Roman numbers", but for
<a href='http://www.google.fr/search?hl=en&q=XXCIIII&btnG=Google+Search'>"XXCIIII"</a>.
This is the way I found the 
Georgette de Montenay book. And I found also the...

<p>
You can notice that, in this example, the double subtraction
is defined for 80, but neither for 30 (it would be useless)
nor for 3.
In addition, for an arabic to roman conversion,
for 40, XXXX is preferred to XL, and for 80,
XXC is preferred to LXXX and for  90 XC is preferred
to LXXXX. This is just an example to show the power
of the module, not to give a consistent result.

<h2>System with only Additions and Subtractions</h2>

<p>
Starting with the Medieval Ages, the system includes
some multiplications. Yet, KM 281 notes that during
the Roman Empire, we can sometimes find "IIM" for
2000. But most examples from the three books come
from the Medieval Era or later. Here are the exemples
gathered by KM and GG.
<pre>

</pre>

In the first example, you see IIIIxx for 80. While the fr-BE word for
eighty is "octante" or "huitante", the fr-FR word for eighty is
"quatre-vingts", litterally "four-score".  So it was written as such
in Roman numerals.
</p>
<p>
And going back to the Palm IIIx, with respect to the
typographical differences between the I's and the x,
I would interpret the number as a multiplicative
number and therefore read this as "Palm 30".
</p>

<h3>Perl</h3>
<p>
I did not check this, I do not know how to represent
the vertical stacking of two characters in a text-only file or a
raised position above the mean height of a line.

<h2>You cannot go beyond 3999?</h2>

<img src='styles-columna-rostrata.png' alt='Various styles for 1000, 5000, 10 000, 50 000 and 100 000, as well as the Columna Rostrata' align='right' />

<p>
When you count things beyond preface pages, 
book chapters and members of a dynasty, for example
when you take a census of the inhabitants
of an empire or when you collect taxes, 
inevitably you go above 3999. 
Even if Adriano Ferreira tells us, in his module's POD:
<blockquote>
Acme::Roman does not like numbers greater than 3999.
Why would you like such big numbers? 
</blockquote>
(Well, this is an <tt>Acme::</tt> module, so it is 
probable Adriano was not entirely serious when writing
this POD.) We have already seen above how, during the Medieval
Ages, the use of multiplication allowed counting beyond 3999.
But even using only addition and subtraction, the Romans could
count way above 3999.

I have already presented the alternate symbol for 1000, U+2180 or <font size="5">&#8576;</font>.
There is also another symbol for 5000, U+2181 or  <font size="5">&#8577;</font> 
and a symbol for 10000 as well, U+2182 or  <font size="5">&#8578;</font>.
But we had to wait for  Unicode version 6 to write
50000 = "|)))" = 
"&#8544;&#8579;&#8579;&#8579;"
and 100000 = "(((|)))" =
"&#8557;&#8557;&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;&#8579;&#8579;".
GI 339 shows 13 glyph variants for these numbers in 
addition to the basic glyph. Here are some of them:
</p>

<p>
On the other side, Romans did not go beyond
100_000. Therefore, to write about a loot of more
than 2 million bronze coins, the Duilius Columna Rostrata
includes between 23 and 33 times the 
<img src='100_000.png' alt='100 000 in Roman numerals' height='30' />
character (or
"&#8557;&#8557;&#8557;&#8544;&#8579;&#8579;&#8579;")
according to the estimates of GI 340.
This is the highest known number written numerically. But 
Romans could go beyond, using number words instead of number symbols.
KM 44 and GG 208 remind us that when Vespasian arrived
on the Roman throne, the public debt was 40 milliards 
sesterces (40 billions for US)
as Suetonius wrote in his <cite>History of the Caesars</cite>.
And note that in another page, in KM 28, it was said
this was the treasury amount, not the public debt.
</p>

<h3>Perl</h3>
<p>
<tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt> can read U+2181 = <font size="5">&#8577;</font> = 5000
and U+2182 = <font size="5">&#8578;</font> = 10000 as well, but
it stops there, like Unicode version 4, and it cannot deal with any
combination of
U+216D, U+2160 and U+2183 for these numbers and for
50_000 and 100_000.
<tt>Roman::Unicode</tt>, released after Unicode version 6, 
uses these chars, plus U+2187 for 50_000 and U+2188 for 100_000.
<tt>Lingua::Romana::Perligata</tt> can print such numbers. Example:
<pre>
use Lingua::Romana::Perligata;

numbro  II tum XVI elevamentum da.

numbrum            tum novumversum egresso scribe.
numbrum comementum tum novumversum egresso scribe.
</pre>
gives:
<pre>
65536
I)))((I))I))DXXXVI
</pre>
I do not know how to write a script in which
<tt>Lingua::Romana::Perligata</tt> 
reads such a number. This is why I use the computation of <tt>2**16</tt>
to fill the variable <tt>$numbr</tt> above.
</p>
<p>
<tt>Math::Roman</tt>, advanced variant, can print such
numbers, but cannot read them. Maybe the parentheses 
impede its normal operation, based on regular expressions.

  print "\n";
}
</pre>
<p>
No other module can deal with these numbers.
</p>

<h2>Very big numbers</h2>

<p>
For the Romans, the threshold for very big numbers
was 100_000, just like the milliard (US billion) is
for us: in our case, we no longer use the same rules and we 
usually adopt a power-of-10 based expression.
Likewise, for the Romans, the basic mechanism
is used until 100_000.
Actually, there is no ancient Latin word for "million"
(ancient Latin as opposed to medieval Latin).
This word was first used by Marco Polo in about 1270 (GG 567)
as an undefined big number, just like our present
day "zillion". The first use of "million" as 
"a thousand thousands" occurred in 1359
(GG 205 KM 143). 
Yet, three jokers crossed the 100_000 Roman limit.
</p>

<p>
In 1582 Freigius used &#8557;&#8557;&#8557;&#8557;|&#8579;&#8579;&#8579;&#8579; for 
one million and |&#8579;&#8579;&#8579;&#8579; for 500_000 (GG 212, GI 338-343).
</p>

<p>
In December 2000, Damian Conway releases
Lingua::Romana::Perligata
where he writes 9999999999 as
(((((((I)))))))((((((((I))))))))((((((I))))))(((((((I)))))))(((((I)))))((((((I))))))((((I))))(((((I)))))(((I)))((((I))))((I))(((I)))M((I))CMXCIX
</p>

<p>
In June 2009 and again in August 2011, Jean Forget presents a talk about
Roman numbers in which he shows Avogadro's number 6E+23 as
|))))))))))))))))))))))(((((((((((((((((((((|)))))))))))))))))))))
and a googol 1E+100 as
((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((|))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
</p>

<p>
Note: we are still far behind Archimedes and his
<cite>Counting of the Sands</cite>, as well as the Hindu mathematicians' achievements.
</p>

<h2>Back to big numbers</h2>

<p>
Another way to write big numbers in Roman numerals
consists in using an overbar to multiply the number
by 1000. And to multiply it by 100_000, the Romans used
a "gate", a rectangular box with the bottom line missing (KM 44 uses the word "frame").
Examples:
</p>

<pre>
              -------
83 000        LXXXIII            GI 339

              ----
4 870         IIIIDCCCLXX        GI 340

              -----
1 200 000     |XII|              GI 342

              ------
1 300 000     |XIII|             GI 342

              ----
200 000 000   |&#8576;&#8576;|               GI 342

              - ------
164 351       c.lxiiij.ccc.l.i   GG 225, Adélard de Bath 1120

</pre>

<p>
The three authors have somewhat diverging opinions about this
technic. 
KM 245-281 writes that this method is mostly seen in
medieval writings and seldom in Roman Empire writings.
During the Roman era, he says that the overbar was a way
to differentiate letter-numerals from real letters.
Examples:
</p>

<pre>
---
IIIVIR = triumvir (KM 281, GI 340)

                 ---
COMMENT PARTAGER DIX CACAHUÈTES ENTRE DIX PERSONNES

<img src='RomanAbacusRecon.jpg' alt='Roman Abacus' align='right' />

<p align='right'><font size="2">

<a href='http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg'>Wikipedia</a>
photo under the <a href='http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_de_documentation_libre_GNU'>GNU FDL</a>.
</font></p>

<p>
GI 340 acknowledges that this method exists (using an overbar to give
a numeric context, but not a 1000-multiplication)
but he considers this is a very old usage, no longer
used at the end of the Roman Republic, when the overbar
was used to multiply by 1000.
We can notice that the use of overbar and gate 
and the use of the <font size="5">&#8576;</font>-like
symbols are not exclusive. They are both used on a
Roman abacus kept at the Cabinet des Médailles 
of the 
Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris (French National Library). 
On this abacus, the first seven headers are:
</p>

<pre>
---
|X|      (((|)))      ((|))       &#8734;    C     X    I
</pre>

<p>
(The rightmost columns show various divisions of the sesterce.
Read KM or GI for more explanations).
</p>

<p>
KM 28, GG 223 and GI 343 include an anecdote
reported by Suetonius in his <cite>History of Caesars</cite>.
In her will, Livia had promised to Galba this amount:
<pre>
   -------
HS 'CCCCC'
</pre>
(Note the short length of the vertical strokes 
of the gate). Thus, Galba was hoping to
receive 50 million sesterces.
<pre>
   -------
HS |CCCCC|
</pre>
(CCCCC within a "gate"). But Tiber
decreated that the will stated only 500000 sesterces,
that is,
<pre>
   -----
HS CCCCC
</pre>
The descending strokes, said he, were much to small
to have any significance.
Note that in KM 28, Galba was to receive only
500 sesterces, because the overbar according to KM
was seldom a multiplication by 1000.
</p>

<p>
GI 341 notes that there is no serious example
of a possible double overbar which would have multiplied
the number by one million. The reason is the Romans had
a big-number threshold at 100_000, not at 1_000_000
(GG 213-218). This did not prevent the 
<a href='http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nombres_romains'>French Wikipedia</a>
to pretend that the millions used a double-macron.
This did not prevent either the W3C to specify the use of
a double- then triple-, quadruple- etc. -overbar, for the
millions, milliards (billions of US), billions (trillions for US)
and so on. See the
<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists/'>specification for HTML lists</a>.
Here is an example of list written as:

<pre>
&lt;ol start='123456789' type='I'&gt;
</pre>
If you browser is recent enough, you will see overlined Roman numbers.
On my computer, this is not the case.
</p>

<ol start='123456789' type='I'>
<li>First element</li>
<li>Second element</li>
</ol>

<h3>Perl</h3>
<p>
<tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt> knows overline (which is good)
and also double overline, triple overline and so on (which
is bad, but consistent with
<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists/'>http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists/</a>). 
It does not know the gate (neither do Unicode and W3C).
And it cannot convert in the other way.
<a href='ex-cnr.en.html' name='ex-cnr'>Here is an example</a> 
(not inline, because the output
is rather lengthy). When I run it on an xterm,
the overlines are properly combined with the preceding
spacing character. But when I display it with Firefox,
the overlines are displayed besides the spacing character.
Your mileage may vary.
</p>



<p>
<tt>Text::Roman</tt> simulates overline by adjoining one or more
underlines (U+005F) and is able to read numbers
written this way, such as "LX_XXIII" which simulates
"L&#772;X&#772;XXIII" (in case you cannot see it, there is a macron
above the first two characters) and is equal to 60023.
Yet, you must use one function for numbers without simulated
overlines and another function for numbers with simulated
overlines:
<pre>
use Text::Roman;

for my $rm (qw/I IV LX_XXIII L_X_XXIII/) {
  my $ar = roman2int($rm);
  print "roman2int  $rm -&gt; $ar\n";
  $ar = mroman2int($rm);
  print "mroman2int $rm -&gt; $ar\n";
}
</pre>
which results in:
<pre>
roman2int  I -&gt; 1
mroman2int I -&gt; 
roman2int  IV -&gt; 4
mroman2int IV -&gt; 
roman2int  LX_XXIII -&gt; 
mroman2int LX_XXIII -&gt; 60023
roman2int  L_X_XXIII -&gt; 
mroman2int L_X_XXIII -&gt; 60023
</pre>
The initial "m" of <tt>mroman2int</tt> means "milhar"
and designates, according to Peter de Padua Krauss 
the roman numbers with a 1000-multiplicating overline.
It seems that this is a word
<a href='http://pt.thefreedictionary.com/milhar'>directly importated from portugese</a>.
This is why I guess that this statement issues from
Peter de Padua Krauss who lives in Brazil according to his e-mail address,
rather than Stanislas Pusep. In addition, the author
makes an error when pretending that the "milhar"
roman numbers can reach 4002999. This number is the result
of the formula 3999x1000+3999, and makes us think that
you may find in the same number thousands expressed as
a M's and thousands expressed as overlined I's.
This is false.
</p>

<p>
No other module can deal with overline.

<h2>A third notation for big numbers</h2>

<p>
My computer's IP address is 2130706433.
But we are used to a dotted notation:
127.0.0.1, using the following factors: 16277216,
65536, 256 and 1. A similar mechanism exists with
Roman numbers, with factors
100000, 1000 and 1.
Examples:
</p>
<pre>
  312 600    III.XII.DC    GG 216 quoting B. Dupiney de Vorepierre's Encyclopedia
1 250 500    XII.L.D       GG 216 quoting Alpinolo Natucci
</pre>

<p>
But there are many irregularities, explained at length by GG.
The dot can mean a multiplication by 1000 or 100000, but it can
simply mean an addition. In some cases, you can guess the
precise roles of the dots, but in other cases, they
are ambiguous. For example,
</p>

<pre>
XVII.L.       may mean any of 17050, 1700050 or 1750000 (GG 218)
II.DCCC.XIIII can only mean 2814 (GG 225)
</pre>

<h2>How did the Romans compute?</h2>

</p>

<p>
If you believe the
<a href='http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nombres_romains'>French Wikipedia</a>,
in order to compute, the Romans had to learn some multiplications
by heart, for exeample XII x XII = CXLIV, which would allow them
to obtain the result of neighbouring computations, that is, the
product of XII by one more or by one less. But knowing the square
of XII will not help you to compute 720 x 62.
I must admit that the author of this paragraph starts his
sentence by "It may be".
Actually, the way the Romans did computations is rather well
known and is described at length in GI's chapter 8 and in
KM's pages 297 to 388 (not all 92 pages deal with Romans, 
many deal with other civilisations). Romans used
abaci (<i lang='fr'>tables à poussière</i> and other
types). This technique actually implies a decimal positional
notation, but it was not fit to record and store numbers.
In other words, the Romans did not know how to implement
persistence in the abacus.
</p>

<p>
The abacus allows you to perform the four basic operations,
but not much more (yet, Richard Feynman reports an encounter
with a Japanese who knew how to compute cubic roots with
a soroban, the operation of which is similar to the abacus
above). But how could the Romans perform complicated
computations? How, for example, could they compute the 
square root of &#960;?
Neither KM, nor GG nor GI explain it, but it is  likely
that the Romans who needed complicated computations,
that is the very few Roman scientists and the more
numerous Roman engineers and architects had received
an education more thorough than their contemporaries.
This education included learning to speak, read and write the
Greek language. Therefore, the scientists, the engineers and
the architects could learn the Greek numerations and the
computation methods devised by their Greek forerunners:
Euclide, Thales, Eratosthene, Archimedes, etc.
</p>

<h2>As a conclusion...</h2>

<p>
The simplified Roman number system, the one everybody
knows, is correctly dealt with by four simple modules
with a light footprint:
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Roman/'><tt>Roman</tt></a>,
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Roman-Unicode/'><tt>Roman::Unicode</tt></a>,
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Roman/'><tt>Text::Roman</tt></a>
and <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-Roman/'><tt>Math::Roman</tt></a>.
You choose the module with the API which suits you
the best. This is not like other domains in which you
are overwhelmed by a plethora of CPAN modules of 
highly varying quality (e-mail, OOP, etc).
As for the fourth serious module,
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Convert-Number-Roman/'><tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt></a>,
the only one which deals with Unicode, we can
only regret it is based on a specification which
is... baroque and unvoluntarily funny.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if you want to deal with the historical
Roman number system, with all its peculiarities and irregularities,
the task is more difficult. Some modules deal with one 
or two aspects of the Roman number system:
overlining with <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Roman/'><tt>Text::Roman</tt></a>
and <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Convert-Number-Roman/'><tt>Convert::Number::Roman</tt></a>
and the "(|)"-like numbers with
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lingua-Romana-Perligata/'><tt>Lingua::Romana::Perligata</tt></a>
and <a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Roman-Unicode/'><tt>Roman::Unicode</tt></a>.
Or you use the advanced variant of 
<a href='http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-Roman/'><tt>Math::Roman</tt></a>
to emulate one or two historical variants.
If you want to emulate all the historical variants
shown above and even trigger an error on invalid input,
you will have to code a rather lengthy call to <tt>tokens</tt>.
I had the intention to write my own conversion module,
which would have dealt with all the mechanisms described above,
but I gave up (temporarily? :-).
And quoting Douglas Adams when he was describing Vogons ships,
if most number systems have been designed, elaborated and built
on sensible and rational grounds, the Roman number system
gives the impression that it was not the result of a design,
but rather of congelation.
